# Web3 ERC721 NFT Dapp Tutorial

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

## Usage

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
npm install

# terminal 1
npx hardhat node

# terminal 2
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/sample-script.js --network localhost

# terminal 3 
npm run dev
```

Update the deployed contract address in `compoonents/Home.js`
